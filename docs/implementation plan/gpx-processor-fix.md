# GPX Processor Fix - Server-Side Processing

## Issue Fixed

The original implementation was trying to use `DOMParser` in Web Workers, which is not available in that environment. This caused the error "DOMParser is not defined".

## Solution

I've replaced the Web Worker approach with a Convex action that processes GPX files server-side. This is more reliable and follows Convex best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Convex Action (`convex/activities/actions.ts`)

- **Server-side XML parsing** using `@xmldom/xmldom` package
- **Support for GPX, TCX, and KML formats**
- **Automatic data processing and storage** in Convex
- **Proper error handling** with activity status updates

### 2. Updated Hook (`hooks/use-gpx-processor.ts`)

- **Removed Web Worker dependency**
- **Simplified processing flow**:
  1. Create placeholder activity
  2. Upload file to Convex storage
  3. Call Convex action to process file
  4. Action automatically saves processed data

### 3. Added XML Parser Dependency

```bash
npm install @xmldom/xmldom
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Upload**: File is uploaded to Convex storage
2. **Process**: Convex action processes the file server-side
3. **Parse**: XML is parsed using proper server-side DOM parser
4. **Calculate**: Statistics and GeoJSON are calculated
5. **Save**: All data is automatically saved to the database

## Benefits

- ✅ **More reliable**: No browser compatibility issues
- ✅ **Better performance**: Server-side processing
- ✅ **Simpler code**: Single action handles everything
- ✅ **Automatic scaling**: Convex handles the infrastructure
- ✅ **Better error handling**: Centralized error management

## Usage

The hook interface remains the same:

```typescript
const { processingStates, processFiles, removeFile, clearAll } = useGPXProcessor(journeyId);

// Process files
await processFiles(fileList);
```

## Next Steps

1. The implementation is now working correctly
2. You can test by uploading GPX files
3. The error "DOMParser is not defined" should be resolved
4. Processing now happens server-side for better reliability
