    *   Users can create new journeys providing a title, description, and an optional cover image.
    *   Ability to edit existing journey details with real-time updates via Convex.
    *   **Enhanced Journey Settings**:
        *   **Default Settings**: Users can set default map styles, activity color palettes, and privacy settings for activities within a journey.
        *   **Visibility**: Options for "Public" (discoverable, if a community feature is added later), "Unlisted" (accessible via direct link), or "Private" (default, only for the user).
        *   **Default Activity Type**: Allow users to set a default activity type (e.g., Hiking, Running, Cycling) for a journey, pre-filled for new GPX uploads.
        *   **Journey Templates**: Pre-configured journey settings for common activity types.
*   **List & Search Journeys**:
    *   A dedicated dashboard displays all user journeys as cards (showing cover image, title, date of last activity).
    *   Journeys can be searched by title or description with real-time filtering.
    *   Filterable by date range, journey status (e.g., Active, Archived), or activity type.
    *   Sortable by creation date, last modified date, title, or total distance.
